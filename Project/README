How to compile and run the project
======

-1: Compile and prepare the native C driver
  -1.1: Navigate to the directory 'src/main/resources/driver' and run 'make'

0: Make sure you have Maven installed (and of course JDK - I used OpenJDK 7)
1: In this folder, run 'mvn package'
2: Make sure the config file 'elevator.config' is up to date with the correct ip_address setting
3: Run - 'java -jar target/ttk4145-proj-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar' (this file includes all the required [3rd party] classes)

This project is written in Java - here's why:
+ Apache ActiveMQ Artemis - https://activemq.apache.org/artemis/
  + Robust - supports persistent messages
  + Supports clustering and automatic discovery of new nodes/handling of lost nodes
  + Fast - low latency and high throughput
  + I already know how to use it
