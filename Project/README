Alternative languages

Java:
Pros/cons:
+ Apache ActiveMQ Artemis - https://activemq.apache.org/artemis/
  + Robust - supports persistent messages
  + Supports clustering and automatic discovery of new nodes/handling of lost nodes
  + Fast - low latency and high throughput
  + I already know how to use it
  - None that I'm aware of so far

C++:
Pros/cons:
+ Known language
+ An ActiveMQ implementation/library exists - http://activemq.apache.org/cms/
  - Needs to connect to existing ActiveMQ (can't be fully embedded without external dependencies)
  - Have not yet used/tested this implementation

Go:
Pros/cons:
+ Channels
+ Made for multithreading and networking
- No (very limited) experience with it so far
- No ActiveMQ, will need to implement our own networking module

PHP:
Pros/cons:
+ Because we were told not to use it (Aka BFUTW)
- Basically everything else (see sites like phpsadness.com ...)
