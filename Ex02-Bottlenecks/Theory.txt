Mutex and Channel basics

*An atomic operation is an operation during which a processor can simultaneously read a location and write it in the same bus operation. When a thread performs an atomic operation, the other threads see it as happening instantaneously.

*A semaphore is a variable or abstract data type that is used for controlling access, by multiple processes, to a common resource in a concurrents system.

*A mutex acts as a gate keeper to a section of code allowing one thread in and blocking access to all others.

*A critical section is a piece of a program that requires mutual exclusion of access. The critical section accesses a shared resource that does not allow multiple concurrent accesses.
